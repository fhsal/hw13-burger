## HW 13 - Eat-da-Burger!

## Summary

This assignment involved building an app which uses Handlebars and builds-out a basic MVC structure application.

Functionally it is simple in that a user can enter the names of burgers to eat which appear on the left and then click a button to 'devour' the burger and it moves over to a list of devoured burgers on the right.

The complete MCV structure was specified in the instructions, including database schema, file names and their functions and how each fits into the MVC framework. The app uses Handlebars templates, Express as middleware, MySQL with an ORM  and is deployed on Heroku using JAWS. Since the entire structure of all the components and their interactions were specified and explained in detail in the instructions, it doesn't make sense to repeat all that information here. The app follows those instructions and includes all those components.

I did, however, add some animation when a burger is 'devoured' and attempted to make the look polished and clean.

The application is fully functional and deployed on Heroku and this link: https://burger-13.herokuapp.com/. Here is a screen shot of the working application's dashboard :

## User Story

- Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

- Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

- Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

- Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
